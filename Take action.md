Take action
主要内容：
There are more and more endangered animals at present, so taking measures to protect animals is no longer an elective.
1. Raise people’s awareness of protecting animals.
2. We have to prevent the environment from getting worse.
3. Stop killing the rare animals just for our own interests, especially the young ones.
备注：
In conclusion, there are more and more animals in danger at present, so protecting them has been our task of top priority.
First, most of people don’t realize the importance of animals, but in some ways, they are more important than we think. In fact not animals need us, but we need them. Without animals, we can hardly survive. So we must raise people’s awareness of protecting animals.
Second, environment has been worse at a rapid rate. If we destroy the nature and take no actions in the face of environment’s getting worse, more and more species habitats will disappear, and then animals will die out. So we have to prevent the environment from getting worse.
Last, a great number of people kill rare animals for money regardless of their survival.  So calling on these people to stop killing animals is an essential way, and if necessary, we must take some legal actions.
