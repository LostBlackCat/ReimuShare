   Ecological equilibrium (ecological balance) refers to the state of high adaptation, coordination and unity between the organisms and the environment in a certain period of time and among the various species of organisms through energy flow, material circulation and information transmission.
   As it's shown in these pictures,we can find that no matter an animal or a group of animals , nature is always more beautiful with the animals,
However, the animals who had lived comfortably lived in danger of extinction. In other words, that's to say, animals are the best partner of nature. Only with animals can the ecological environment become better and better, and nature becomes more and more beautiful.
   As we all know , animals are the most important part of the ecology balance, which are called consumer in the food chain.And each kind of animals have different effect in ecology balance.For example,herbivores can keep the amount of plants, Carnivorous animal can keep the amount of herbivors.
   But many people just don't understand the use of animals.They regard animals as goods, just for their own profit.Besides,lots of people don't 
understand animals,they think animals have no emotions even the feel of pain.So they kill the animals as they wanted,which sometimes there is no meanings.
   If the balance of ecology is broken, the next victim must be humans.So it's of great importance to understand animals and treat animals in a suitable way rather than just kill them to get money.Animals also have some human emotions, like mercy , pain , anger. I believe if we treat animals well , they will treat us well too and maybe save humans in the future.
